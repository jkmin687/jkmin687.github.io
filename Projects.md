## Programs & Internships

<a name="aws-project"></a>
### Cybersecurity Cloud Risk Analyst Internship: AWS & NIST 800-171
[View Full Report](Cyber_Risk_Internship.md)
   - Served as a **Cloud Risk Analyst** responsible for assessing the security posture of a simulated **AWS environment** handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
   - **Executed Automated Vulnerability Scans** using **AWS Prowler** and **Qualys TotalCloud**, analyzing thousands of lines of JSON output to identify critical misconfigurations such as open S3 buckets and lack of MFA on root accounts.
   - **Performed Framework Mapping**, translating technical scan findings into **NIST SP 800-171** control gaps (e.g., Mapping "MFA Missing" to *Control 3.5.3*).
   - **Developed a Risk Register**, calculating risk scores based on likelihood and impact, and assigning severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low) to guide executive remediation prioritization.
   - **Cross-Walked Compliance Standards**, demonstrating how the identified NIST gaps also resulted in non-compliance with **ISO 27001** and **SOC 2** requirements.

### Deloitte Cyber Program
[View Full Report](programs/Deloitte_Cyber_Program.pdf)
   - Served as a Cybersecurity Analyst investigating the **web activity logs** of a suspected security breach.
   - Conducted **Behavioral Traffic Analysis** on server logs to distinguish between legitimate human users and automated bots, specifically identifying headless browsing patterns where API data was queried without dashboard resources needed to display data.
   - Identified the anomaly a specific User ID that exhibited a mechanical "heartbeat" signature, executing requests at the exact same second every hour (e.g., XX:00:48).
   - Analyzed session persistence, discovering a "zombie script" that continued to query the system for 16 hours despite receiving consecutive 401 Unauthorized errors, indicating non-human user traits.

### PwC Cyber Security Consulting Program: SOX & ITGC
[View Full Report](programs/PwC_Cyber_Security_Consulting_Program.pdf)
   - Served as a **Cyber Security Consultant** assessing a client's **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)** lifecycle against **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** compliance requirements.
   - **Conducted Segregation of Duties (SoD) Analysis**, identifying a critical control failure where a single user possessed the ability to both *create* a vendor and *process* payments, creating a high risk for fraud.
   - **Executed Test of Design (ToD)** and **Operating Effectiveness (OE)** testing on IT General Controls (ITGCs), specifically reviewing Change Management logs and Access Control lists.
   - **Drafted an Audit Deficiencies Report**, clearly documenting the "Condition, Criteria, Cause, and Effect" of the identified failures.
   - **Presented Strategic Remediation Plans** to the Audit Committee, recommending the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to resolve the SoD conflicts.

## Technical Projects

<a name="servicenow"></a>
### ServiceNow GRC: Automated "NIST ComplianceGuard" Application
[View Full Report](programs/ServiceNow_ComplianceGuard_Dashboard.pdf.pdf)
   - Engineered a custom Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Application within ServiceNow, migrating an organization from static Excel spreadsheets to an automated system of record based on the **NIST SP 800-53** framework.
   - **Architected the Database Schema** by extending the core Task table to ensure audit trail inheritance and executed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to normalize raw data using Transform Maps and Coalescing strategies.
   - Reduced **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** to critical compliance failures by **99%** (cutting reaction time from ~24 hours to <5 seconds) by implementing **Server-Side Logic** and **Flow Designer** workflows that instantly trigger remediation incidents.
   - Conducted **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** via a "Smoke Test" simulation (SIM-999), verifying that a control failure immediately triggered the automated remediation workflow and alert system.
   - **Designed a "CISO Command Center" Dashboard**, providing executives with real-time visualization of the organization's security posture through **Compliance Overview** charts and **Critical Action Item** lists.

### CodePath Intro to Web Development Project
[View Full Report](programs/Codepath_Web101.md)
   - Completed an intensive 10-week **Intro to Web Development** course, gaining foundational knowledge in developing a function website from the bottom-up.
   - **Developed a Responsive Website** utilizing **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
   - **Implemented API Integrations**, fetching data from external sources to display dynamic content to the user.
