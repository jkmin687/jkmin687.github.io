## Programs & Internships

<a name="aws-project"></a>
### Cybersecurity Cloud Risk Analyst Internship: AWS & NIST 800-171
[View Full Report](https://github.com/jkmin687/Risk-Analyst-Internship/blob/main/README.md)
   - Served as a **Cloud Risk Analyst** responsible for assessing the security posture of a simulated **AWS environment** handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
   - **Executed Automated Vulnerability Scans** using **AWS Prowler** and **Qualys TotalCloud**, analyzing thousands of lines of JSON output to identify critical misconfigurations such as open S3 buckets and lack of MFA on root accounts.
   - **Performed Framework Mapping**, translating technical scan findings into **NIST SP 800-171** control gaps (e.g., Mapping "MFA Missing" to *Control 3.5.3*).
   - **Developed a Risk Register**, calculating risk scores based on likelihood and impact, and assigning severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low) to guide executive remediation prioritization.
   - **Cross-Walked Compliance Standards**, demonstrating how the identified NIST gaps also resulted in non-compliance with **ISO 27001** and **SOC 2** requirements.

### PwC Cyber Security Consulting Program: SOX & ITGC
[View Full Report](programs/PwC_Cyber_Security_Consulting_Program.pdf)
   - Served as a **Cyber Security Consultant** assessing a client's **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)** lifecycle against **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** compliance requirements.
   - **Conducted Segregation of Duties (SoD) Analysis**, identifying a critical control failure where a single user possessed the ability to both *create* a vendor and *process* payments, creating a high risk for fraud.
   - **Executed Test of Design (ToD)** and **Operating Effectiveness (OE)** testing on IT General Controls (ITGCs), specifically reviewing Change Management logs and Access Control lists.
   - **Drafted an Audit Deficiencies Report**, clearly documenting the "Condition, Criteria, Cause, and Effect" of the identified failures.
   - **Presented Strategic Remediation Plans** to the Audit Committee, recommending the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to resolve the SoD conflicts.
