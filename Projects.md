# 📂 Projects, Programs, Experience, and Certifications

This page represents my passion and dedication to cybersecurity, showcasing a collection of projects, hands-on labs, and professional programs that have helped shape my journey. Each project has provided me with the opportunity to dive deeper into cybersecurity principles, gain practical, real-world experience, and sharpen my technical skills. From formal training initiatives to independent explorations, this portfolio reflects my growth as I pursue my goal of becoming a skilled cybersecurity professional.

As you explore this page, you’ll find the highlights of programs I’ve completed, projects I’ve worked on, and labs where I’ve challenged myself to continuously learn and improve upon my skills. I’ve also included links to reports, datasets, and presentations to give you more insight into my work. I hope you enjoy following along on my journey as much as I’ve enjoyed living it—thank you for visiting!

## Programs & Virtual Experience

### Cloud Risk Analyst Internship: AWS & NIST 800-171
[View Full Repository](https://github.com/jkmin687/Risk-Analyst-Internship/blob/main/README.md)
   - Served as a **Cloud Risk Analyst** responsible for assessing the security posture of a simulated **AWS environment** handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
   - **Executed Automated Vulnerability Scans** using **AWS Prowler**, analyzing thousands of lines of JSON output to identify critical misconfigurations such as open S3 buckets and lack of MFA on root accounts.
   - **Performed Framework Mapping**, translating technical scan findings into **NIST SP 800-171** control gaps (e.g., Mapping "MFA Missing" to *Control 3.5.3*).
   - **Developed a Risk Register**, calculating risk scores based on likelihood and impact, and assigning severity levels (High/Medium/Low) to guide executive remediation prioritization.
   - **Cross-Walked Compliance Standards**, demonstrating how the identified NIST gaps also resulted in non-compliance with **ISO 27001** and **SOC 2** requirements.

### PwC Cybersecurity Consulting Program: SOX & ITGC
[View Full Report](programs/PwC_Cyber_Security_Consulting_Program.pdf)
   - Served as a **Cyber Security Consultant** engaged to assess a client's **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** lifecycle against **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** compliance requirements.
   - **Conducted Segregation of Duties (SoD) Analysis**, identifying a critical control failure where a single user possessed the ability to both *create* a vendor and *process* payments, creating a high risk for fraud.
   - **Executed Test of Design (ToD)** and **Operating Effectiveness (OE)** testing on IT General Controls (ITGCs), specifically reviewing Change Management logs and Access Control lists.
   - **Drafted an Audit Deficiencies Report**, clearly documenting the "Condition, Criteria, Cause, and Effect" of the identified failures.
   - **Presented Strategic Remediation Plans** to the Audit Committee, recommending the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to resolve the SoD conflicts.

## Technical Projects

### ServiceNow GRC: "NIST ComplianceGuard" Application
[View Full Repository](https://github.com/jkmin687/NCSR-Based-Cybersecurity-Maturity-Assessment/tree/main)
   - Designed, architected, and deployed a **custom GRC application** within the **ServiceNow App Engine** to automate the lifecycle of **NIST SP 800-53** controls.
   - **Built Custom Data Tables** to ingest Authority Documents (NIST Standards), creating a relational database that links specific regulations to internal policy citations.
   - **Automated Workflows with Flow Designer**, configuring logic that automatically triggers email notifications to Control Owners 30 days before an audit cycle begins.
   - **Created Executive Dashboards**, visualizing real-time compliance posture using pie charts and heat maps to show the percentage of "Compliant" vs. "Non-Compliant" controls.
   - **Reduced Audit Fatigue**, demonstrating how automated evidence collection can reduce the manual workload of spreadsheet-based compliance by over 40%.

### CodePath Web Development Project
   - Completed an intensive 10-week **Intro to Web Development** course, gaining foundational knowledge in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
   - **Developed a Responsive Website** utilizing **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
   - **Implemented API Integrations**, fetching data from external sources to display dynamic content to the user.
   - **Version Control Management**, utilizing **Git and GitHub** for source code management, branching, and committing changes—skills that directly translate to managing "Policy-as-Code" in GRC.

## Labs

### CompTIA Security+ Labs
   - **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Configured Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in a Windows Server environment to enforce password complexity and lockout policies.
   - **Network Security:** Utilized **Wireshark** to capture and analyze packet traffic, identifying clear-text credentials and simulating man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Deployed **Nessus Essentials** to scan a local network, interpreting severity scores and patching identified vulnerabilities in a controlled sandbox environment.
