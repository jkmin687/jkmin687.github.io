## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
My name is Justin Min, and I am a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional specialized in bridging the gap between regulatory requirements and technical security. I hold a degree from Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business, where I majored in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity.

With a unique background in legal compliance and cybersecurity, I have hands-on experience translating complex laws (e.g. NIST, SOX, ISO 27001) into actionable security strategies. I am continually advancing my expertise in IT auditing, risk assessment, and control automation, applying a risk-centric mindset to protect critical assets. My approach blends a detail-oriented mindset with technical efficiency to enhance organizational resilience and streamline compliance maturity.

## 📖 Professional Background
I began my academic journey in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity, fascinated by the technical architecture of cybersecurity. However, it was during a pivotal Cybersecurity Cloud Risk Analyst capstone internship that my true passion ignited. I realized that effective security wasn't just about firewalls—it was about governance, strategy, and managing the human element of risk.

Driven to master the regulatory side of this equation, I immersed myself in the legal field as a Paralegal. This role allowed me to sharpen my skills in regulatory compliance, forensic documentation, and auditing, instilling the precise, detail-oriented mindset that is critical for Cybersecurity GRC. As I continued to apply these legal skills to technical challenges—through hands-on projects and virtual simulations—my commitment to the GRC field only deepened.

Today, I possess a unique blend of experiences that bridge the gap between legal precision and technical cybersecurity. My journey reflects a deliberate pursuit of the "why" and "how" behind security frameworks, with a clear mission to build resilient, compliant, and secure infrastructures for the future.

## 📂 Featured Projects & Experiences

### Cloud Risk Analyst Internship: AWS & NIST 800-171
[View Full Report](https://github.com/jkmin687/Risk-Analyst-Internship/blob/main/README.md)
   - Served as a **Cloud Risk Analyst** responsible for assessing the security posture of a simulated **AWS environment** handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
   - **Executed Automated Vulnerability Scans** using **AWS Prowler** and **Qualys TotalCloud**, analyzing thousands of lines of JSON output to identify critical misconfigurations such as open S3 buckets and lack of MFA on root accounts.
   - **Performed Framework Mapping**, translating technical scan findings into **NIST SP 800-171** control gaps (e.g., Mapping "MFA Missing" to *Control 3.5.3*).
   - **Developed a Risk Register**, calculating risk scores based on likelihood and impact, and assigning severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low) to guide executive remediation prioritization.
   - **Cross-Walked Compliance Standards**, demonstrating how the identified NIST gaps also resulted in non-compliance with **ISO 27001** and **SOC 2** requirements.

### PwC Cyber Security Consulting Program: SOX & ITGC
[View Full Report](programs/PwC_Cyber_Security_Consulting_Program.pdf)
   - Served as a **Cyber Security Consultant** assessing a client's **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)** lifecycle against **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** compliance requirements.
   - **Conducted Segregation of Duties (SoD) Analysis**, identifying a critical control failure where a single user possessed the ability to both *create* a vendor and *process* payments, creating a high risk for fraud.
   - **Executed Test of Design (ToD)** and **Operating Effectiveness (OE)** testing on IT General Controls (ITGCs), specifically reviewing Change Management logs and Access Control lists.
   - **Drafted an Audit Deficiencies Report**, clearly documenting the "Condition, Criteria, Cause, and Effect" of the identified failures.
   - **Presented Strategic Remediation Plans** to the Audit Committee, recommending the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to resolve the SoD conflicts.

### ServiceNow GRC: Automated "NIST ComplianceGuard" Application
[View Full Repository](https://github.com/jkmin687/NCSR-Based-Cybersecurity-Maturity-Assessment/tree/main)
   - Designed, architected, and deployed a **custom GRC application** within **ServiceNow** to automate the lifecycle of **NIST SP 800-53** controls.
   - **Built Custom Data Tables** to ingest Authority Documents (NIST Standards), creating a relational database that links specific regulations to internal policy citations.
   - **Created Executive Dashboards**, visualizing real-time compliance posture using pie charts and heat maps to show the percentage of "Compliant" vs. "Non-Compliant" controls.
   - **Reduced Audit Fatigue**, demonstrating how automated evidence collection can reduce the manual workload of spreadsheet-based compliance by over 40%.
