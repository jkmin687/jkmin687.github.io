## 👨🏽‍💻 Professional Summary
My name is **Justin Min**. I am a graduate of Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business with a degree in Computer Information Systems. 

What defines my career is the transition from the **Legal Field to Cybersecurity**. In law, documentation is the shield; in cybersecurity, it is the blueprint. I leverage my experience in sensitive evidence handling and detail-oriented legal documentation to excel in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** and **SOC Analysis**.

> **Mission Statement:** To protect the future of digital infrastructure by applying a "zero-error" legal mindset to technical security controls.
