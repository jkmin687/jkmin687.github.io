## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
My name is Justin Min, and I am a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional specialized in bridging the gap between regulatory requirements and technical security. I hold a degree from Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business, where I majored in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity.

With a unique background in legal compliance and cybersecurity, I have hands-on experience translating complex laws (e.g. NIST, SOX, ISO 27001) into actionable security strategies. I am continually advancing my expertise in IT auditing, risk assessment, and control automation, applying a risk-centric mindset to protect critical assets. My approach blends a detail-oriented mindset with technical efficiency to enhance organizational resilience and streamline compliance maturity.

## 📖 Professional Background
I began my academic journey in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity, fascinated by the technical architecture of cybersecurity. However, it was during a pivotal Cybersecuirty Cloud Risk Analyst capstone internship that my true passion ignited. I realized that effective security wasn't just about firewalls—it was about governance, strategy, and managing the human element of risk.

Driven to master the regulatory side of this equation, I immersed myself in the legal field as a Paralegal. This role allowed me to sharpen my skills in regulatory compliance, forensic documentation, and auditing, instilling the precise, detail-oriented mindset that is critical for Cybersecurity GRC. As I continued to apply these legal skills to technical challenges—through hands-on projects and virtual simulations—my commitment to the GRC field only deepened.

Today, I possess a unique blend of experiences that bridge the gap between legal precision and technical cybersecurity. My journey reflects a deliberate pursuit of the "why" and "how" behind security frameworks, with a clear mission to build resilient, compliant, and secure infrastructures for the future.
