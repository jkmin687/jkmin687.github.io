## 📖 Professional Background
I began my career in the legal field, where precision, documentation, and analytical thinking were paramount. In the law, a single word can change a contract; in cybersecurity, a single misconfigured control can compromise an enterprise. 

This curiosity led me to bridge the gap between legal policy and technical implementation. Today, I combine my legal precision with technical security practices to protect infrastructure, strengthen identity management, and navigate complex regulatory landscapes like **NIST**, **SOC 2**, and **ISO 27001**.
