## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
My name is Justin Min, and I am a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professional specialized in bridging the gap between regulatory requirements and technical security. I hold a degree from Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business, where I majored in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity.

With a unique background in legal compliance and cybersecurity, I have hands-on experience translating complex laws (e.g. NIST, SOX, ISO 27001) into actionable security strategies. I am continually advancing my expertise in IT auditing, risk assessment, and control automation, applying a risk-centric mindset to protect critical assets. My approach blends a detail-oriented mindset with technical efficiency to enhance organizational resilience and streamline compliance maturity.

## 📖 Professional Background
I began my academic journey in Computer Information Systems with a focus on Cybersecurity, fascinated by the technical architecture of cybersecurity. However, it was during a pivotal Cybersecuirty Cloud Risk Analyst capstone internship that my true passion ignited. I realized that effective security wasn't just about firewalls—it was about governance, strategy, and managing the human element of risk.

Driven to master the regulatory side of this equation, I immersed myself in the legal field as a Paralegal. This role allowed me to sharpen my skills in regulatory compliance, forensic documentation, and auditing, instilling the precise, detail-oriented mindset that is critical for Cybersecurity GRC. As I continued to apply these legal skills to technical challenges—through hands-on projects and virtual simulations—my commitment to the GRC field only deepened.

Today, I possess a unique blend of experiences that bridge the gap between legal precision and technical cybersecurity. My journey reflects a deliberate pursuit of the "why" and "how" behind security frameworks, with a clear mission to build resilient, compliant, and secure infrastructures for the future.

## 📂 Featured Projects & Experiences

### 🔎 [ServiceNow Compliance & Risk Automated Dashboard](https://github.com/jkmin687/NCSR-Based-Cybersecurity-Maturity-Assessment/tree/main)
- Developed, built, and deployed a custom Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) application within the ServiceNow platform. The goal was to transition from manual, spreadsheet-based compliance tracking to an automated, centralized system based on the NIST 800-53 framework.
- The system ingests security control data, automates risk scoring based on compliance status, and visualizes real-time security posture for executive stakeholders.

### ☁️ [Cloud Risk Analyst Internship](https://github.com/jkmin687/Risk-Analyst-Internship/blob/main/README.md)
- Served as a Cybersecuirty Cloud Risk Anlayst, scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in an AWS cloud environment.
- Mapped controls to NIST SP 800-171 and developed a risk register complete with risk matrices, severity classfication, mitigation recommendations, and cross-framework mapping to ISCO 2001 and SOC 2.

### 🛡️ [PwC CyberSecurity Consulting Program](https://github.com/jkmin687/HTB-SOC-Analyst)
- Served as a **Cyber Security Consultant** to assess a client's **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** lifecycle against **SOX compliance** requirements, identifying **6 key control failures** including Segregation of Duties (SoD) conflicts.
- Conducted **Test of Design (ToD)** and **Operating Effectiveness (OE)** testing on IT General Controls (ITGCs), documenting evidence failures in Change Management and drafting a strategic remediation plan for senior stakeholders.
