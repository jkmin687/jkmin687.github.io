## 🤔 Who Am I?

Hi, I’m Justin Min. I am a graduate of Georgia State University’s J. Mack Robinson College of Business, where I concentrated on Computer Information Systems and Cybersecurity. 

My path to cybersecurity is unique: I carry a **professional legal background** that has instilled in me a "compliance-first" mindset. In the legal world, every word in a contract matters; in the GRC world, every control in a framework matters. I’ve found that my ability to parse complex legal requirements translates perfectly into auditing system security and managing risk.

Outside of the digital world, I am [Insert your hobbies here - e.g., staying active, reading, or specific interests]. Much like cybersecurity, [Hobby X] requires [discipline/strategy/patience], which is a mindset I bring to every audit walkthrough and risk assessment I perform.
